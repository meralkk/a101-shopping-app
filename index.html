        <h2>Project Brief</h2>
        <p>
          A101 online shopping is an application that allows products such as
          food, beverage, cleaning products to be ordered online and delivered
          to the address.
        </p>
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Discover the pain points of the current app and propose solutions
          to¬†improve user experience.
        </p>
        <h2>The Goal</h2>
        <p>
          The goal was to understand A101 Online Shopping users' response to the
          current mobile app, discover pain points, and propose some solutions
          to improve their experiences.
        </p>
        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>
          I prepared this study in line with Userspots' 6-week training. My role
          here is to prepare both UX and UI design.
        </p>
        <h2>Tools</h2>
        <p>Figma, Miro, Google Slide</p>

        <p>

          <li>Can you tell me about your daily routine?</li>

          <li>How often do you shop online?</li>
          <li>What does it mean to you that the application is useful?</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          "Its interface looks simple even though it does a lot of work, so it
          has an interface that you don't need too much effort to do something."

        <ul>
          <li>
            How was the registration process for the mobile application for you?

            "I purchase my weekly shopping online instead of going out due to
            the pandemic." "When I'm looking for something, if I don't have
            anything specific in my mind, I get lost in that category."
            "Usability is to get what I am looking for as soon as possible." "If
            it is not urgent for me, I usually wait for the campaign and

        <p>
          <i>
            I conducted tests with 3 people who did not use the application
            before, to measure the usability and comprehensibility of the
            product over scenarios I had previously determined. I set up 4
            different scenarios in these tests.</i
          >
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Research questions:</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Can the user easily find the product he/she is looking for?</li>
          <li>Is the information given in the product details sufficient?</li>
          <li>Is it easy to choose a product quantity?</li>
          <li>Is it difficult to add to the cart?¬†</li>
          <li>
            What kind of a path does he/she follow when searching for a product
            with a special offer?
          </li>
          <li>Is it having difficulty completing the checkout step?</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h3>Usability Testing/ Scenario 1</h3>

        <p>
          In the evening your friends come to dinner, you want to prepare a nice
          meal for them, but you realize that there are no mushrooms at home and
          you need to buy mushrooms.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Usability Testing/ Scenario 2</h3>

        <p>
          You want to buy a product, but you are torn between two alternatives.
          Maybe you may return a product you buy later. For this, you want to
          know what the return conditions are.

      <p>This UX case study has been a challenging and rewarding experience for me. It was challenging to prepare suitable questions for users and to create scenarios for use. However, it has been a great experience to understand users and find out what works.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I am happy to learn that even by making small changes to this project, we can make a big impact and create a great experience for users. It is very important to always validate our assumptions by testing them.</p>
