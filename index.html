        <h2>Project Brief</h2>
        <p>
          A101 online shopping is an application that allows products such as
          food, beverage, cleaning products to be ordered online and delivered
          to the address.
        </p>
        <h2>The Problem</h2>
        <p>
          Discover the pain points of the current app and propose solutions
          to¬†improve user experience.
        </p>
        <h2>The Goal</h2>
        <p>
          The goal was to understand A101 Online Shopping users' response to the
          current mobile app, discover pain points, and propose some solutions
          to improve their experiences.
        </p>
        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>
          I prepared this study in line with Userspots' 6-week training. My role
          here is to prepare both UX and UI design.

        <h2>1Ô∏è‚É£ In-depth Interview</h2>
        <p>
          <i>
            Based on the questions I prepared before, I interviewed 3 users who
            used the A101 application.</i
          >
        </p>
        <br />

        <h3>Main research questions:</h3>
        <br />

        <ul>
          <li>Can you tell me a little bit about yourself?</li>
          <li>Can you tell me about your daily routine?</li>
          <li>How do you do your grocery shopping?</li>
          <li>How often do you shop online?</li>
          <li>What does it mean to you that the application is useful?</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          "Its interface looks simple even though it does a lot of work, so it
          has an interface that you don't need too much effort to do something."
        </p>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>
            How was the registration process for the mobile application for you?
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          "When you want to look at the products without entering an address, it
          gives an error, you have to enter an address."
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <div class="quotes">
          <h2>Key Quotes directly from the users:</h2>
          <p>
            "I purchase my weekly shopping online instead of going out due to
            the pandemic." "When I'm looking for something, if I don't have
            anything specific in my mind, I get lost in that category."
            "Usability is to get what I am looking for as soon as possible." "If
            it is not urgent for me, I usually wait for the campaign and
            discount periods." "I do not have to enter my address and become a
            member to view products and categories."
          </p>

        <h2>2Ô∏è‚É£ Usability Testing</h2>
        
        <p>
          <i>
            I conducted tests with 3 people who did not use the application
            before, to measure the usability and comprehensibility of the
            product over scenarios I had previously determined. I set up 4
            different scenarios in these tests.</i
          >
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Research questions:</h3>
        <br />
        <ul>
          <li>Can the user easily find the product he/she is looking for?</li>
          <li>Is the information given in the product details sufficient?</li>
          <li>Is it easy to choose a product quantity?</li>
          <li>Is it difficult to add to the cart?¬†</li>
          <li>
            What kind of a path does he/she follow when searching for a product
            with a special offer?
          </li>
          <li>Is it having difficulty completing the checkout step?</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <h3>Usability Testing/ Scenario 1</h3>

        <p>
          In the evening your friends come to dinner, you want to prepare a nice
          meal for them, but you realize that there are no mushrooms at home and
          you need to buy mushrooms.
        </p>
        <br />
        <h3>Usability Testing/ Scenario 2</h3>

        <p>
          You want to buy a product, but you are torn between two alternatives.
          Maybe you may return a product you buy later. For this, you want to
          know what the return conditions are.
